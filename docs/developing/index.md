This repo makes extensive use of a single `virtualenv` and `pip install -e`

## Linux / OSX

To get things going run `./scripts/bootstrap.sh`

```
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

This will:

1. Create a `virtualenv` that all the packages in this repo can use
2. Install some trick prerequisites like GDAL, Cython, Scipy and rasterio etc.
2. Run `pip install -e` on each repo to link them up.


## Windows

1. Install python 3.8.3
2. Install C++ build tools: <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>
3. Install git bash and make sure VSCode has this set as its default terminal
4. Install `virtualenv` in the root using `pip install virtualenv`

Go and get the wheel files.
<https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>

You'll need these. Actual file names may vary if you have a slightly different version of python `cp38 ==> python 3.8`

```
Cython-0.29.21-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
GDAL-3.1.2-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
rasterio-1.1.5-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
Rtree-0.9.4-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
Shapely‑1.7.1‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl
```

once you've downloaded these make sure to pip install them OUTSIDE of any virtualenv (so just pip install in terminal)

```bash
pip install Cython-0.29.21-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
```

Now run `./scripts/bootstrap-win.sh` from the root of this repo using git bash


## VSCode Settings

Minor note: for windows machines the pythonpath should be:

```
"python.pythonPath": "../../.venv/scripts/python.exe",
```

***CAVEAT:*** You will need to select a new interpreter for windows and this means that your `settings.json` files will constantly show up as having been changed. Please don't commit these files to git as they will change the environment for everyone else.

Microsoft is looking into platform-specific settings for VSCode but these haven't been implemented yet so we're ahead of the curve.

```json

  "python.pythonPath": "../../.venv/bin/python",
